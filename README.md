bbzfc | BetterBZFlagClone

## The idea

There exists a great-great game called [BZFlag](http://bzflag.org/). In the
past, I enjoyed playing it very much! Things have changed though...
I don't like where BZFlag is heading, and it's current state. I have
followed the BZFlag forums for quite for some time now, and noticed that I
am not alone in thinking that something needs to change. However, with the
way BZFlag project is setup, it's impossible to introduce ground-braking
changes. Changes that absolutely must happen for the game to survive.
Therefore I am starting a clone of BZFlag. I dream that one day, a game
in the spirit of BZFlag will be completed, but a game that is better than
the original BZFlag.

## The plan

People like me need to gather together, and discuss several things in order
for the project to really take up pace.

1. [Game engine. To use one or not.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/1)
2. [Gameplay elements from BZFlag that must remain.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/2)
3. [Gameplay elements from BZFlag that should be abandoned.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/3)
4. [Flags to keep. Flags to drop = )](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/4)
4. [Server design.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/5)
5. [Foundation matters.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/6)
6. [Manifesto of the project](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/7)

At this stage, these things can be discussed in separate GitHub issues
(click on any one of them, and you will be directed to the Issue page).
Anyone can contribute to the discussion, you just need to be registered with
GitHub.

## My vision

1. Open source. In the spirit of original free and open source BZFlag.
2. Similar game play. Similar mechanics. Maybe a simplification of the world a bit (reduction of the number of "fancy"
flags). The idea is that an old player playing the "Better BZFlag Clone" should get the feeling like he is playing the
original BZFlag, but with 10x better everything  :)
3. Using OpenGL 3+ from the start. Better graphics. Modern graphics feel.
4. Complete rewrite. A.k.a. a clone - and not a fork!
5. Support for mobile platforms (Google Play, Apple App Store, etc.). Support for embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, etc.).
6. Complete rethink of BZFlag server. It needs to be in complete control over game state (prevent cheating). It also
needs to manage players and their level, game matches, chat, etc. One can look at http://battle.net to see the direction
I intend to push in.
7. Tutorials, better single player, maybe a campaign  :) . Basically, what a modern player expects to find in the game
first time he plays it. New players must get a feel for the game before they are exposed to online play.
8. A web site representing the project with a modern look and feel. With videos of game play, cool screenshots,
documentation, tutorials. i18n and friends. Maybe a YouTube channel. Basically, Public Relations is a very important
concept!
9. Last but NOT LEAST! A good foundation for the whole concept of the "Better BZFlag Clone". What I mean by this is
something like The Linux Foundation http://www.linuxfoundation.org/ . Also, from the start, the project should have a
solid manifesto. Take a look, for example, at The Debian Manifesto
https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ap-manifesto.en.html . I want to make it so that the
"Better BZFlag Clone" doesn't end up in the same state that the current BZFlag is in (the politics, the licensing
issues, code ownership, project leadership, etc.)
