bbzfc | BetterBZFlagClone

## The idea

There exists a great-great game called [BZFlag](http://bzflag.org/). In the
past, I enjoyed playing it very much! Things have changed though...
I don't like where BZFlag is heading, and it's current state. I have
followed the BZFlag forums for quite for some time now, and noticed that I
am not alone in thinking that something needs to change. However, with the
way BZFlag project is setup, it's impossible to introduce ground-braking
changes. Changes that absolutely must happen for the game to survive.
Therefore I am starting a clone of BZFlag. I dream that one day, a game
in the spirit of BZFlag will be completed, but a game that is better than
the original BZFlag.

## The plan

People like me need to gather together, and discuss several things in order
for the project to really take up pace.

1. [Game engine. To use one or not.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/1)
2. [Gameplay elements from BZFlag that must remain.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/2)
3. [Gameplay elements from BZFlag that should be abandoned.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/3)
4. [Flags to keep. Flags to drop = )](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/4)
4. [Server design.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/5)
5. [Foundation matters.](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/6)
6. [Manifesto of the project](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/bbzfc/issues/7)

At this stage, these things can be discussed in separate GitHub issues
(click on any one of them, and you will be directed to the Issue page).
Anyone can contribute to the discussion, you just need to be registered with
GitHub.
