Some old stuff that's not actual as of this moment.

## Forum

A forum has been setup at [http://forum.bbzfc.net/](http://forum.bbzfc.net/). Several categories exist on the forum
for the following purposes:

- Project announcements. See the **Announcements** category.
- Day-2-day updates. See the **Blogs** category.
- General discussions about project (development, roadmap, etc.). See the **General Discussion** category.
- User concerns and requests. See the **Comments & Feedback** category.

## Real time chat

The purpose of real time chat is to quickly connect and discuss ideas and/or concerns in real time. Real time chat is
not a permanent place, so don't expect to find documentation there. Also, don't expect for real time chat logs (if such
exist) to always be available. A last note - everyone is welcome to join = )

- IRC channel. Please connect to the IRC channel **#bbzfc** on the  **freenode** server. You can find the logs of this
channel at [http://irclog.bbzfc.net/](http://irclog.bbzfc.net/).
- Slack collaboration. Access URL is [https://bbzfc.slack.com/](https://bbzfc.slack.com/) (please send an e-mail to
<admin@bbzfc.net> if you are unable to join/register on the forum).
