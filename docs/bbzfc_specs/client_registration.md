# Client registration

New clients (gamers, players) will have 2 options to register with a **Main Server**.

1. Registering from scratch. The client will need to provide a username and a password, along with their e-mail address.
Their account will be tied to their e-mail address. Account verification will be handled via e-mail.
2. Registering using a 3rd party service, such as Google or Facebook. Each time they login, they will be redirected
first to the 3rd party service login prompt (if they aren't logged in there yet), and then back to the game.
Account verification will not be necessary with this option.

After registration (and, if necessary, account verification), the client can proceed to choose a nickname on the
**Main Server**. Once chosen, a nickname can't be changed in the future.
