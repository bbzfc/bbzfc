All aspect of **Tank Battle Portal** server infrastructure setup will be automatized with scripts. The only separate
custom configuring the administrator will need to do is:

- Linux distribution specific configuration.
- Domain name specific configurations (usually on the domain registrar's side).
- Making sure that the various servers are reachable via the Internet.
- Network security. Taking care of any network holes. Enabling necessary network ports.

Also, if the portal administrator will want to introduce some scheme of making users pay for accessing the portal,
he will need to implement this functionality himself.
