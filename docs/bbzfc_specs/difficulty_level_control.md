---

One of the configuration parameters of a **Game World** is the upper limit on the **Player Level** that can join to
play. By default, anyone can join without a constraint on their **Player Level**. But if a group of people want to
organize a match for relative newcomers (or for advanced super players), then they can create a new **Game World** and
set an appropriate upper limit (or a lower limit) on the **Player Level** parameter.

In the future, if the player base will be great enough, a **Main Server** may chose to automatically create several
**Game Worlds** with the same configuration only with different **Player Level** settings. So that players that connect
to it can decide on how powerful an opponent they want to play against.
