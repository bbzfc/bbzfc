---

Once the user is authenticated, he will have access to the system. Inside the system there will exist a hierarchy of
roles which will allow access to various functionality. For example,

- general game play
- user administration
- server management
- global announcements
- chatroom administration
- etc.

The roles can be freely added and removed for clients by a user with the power to do so.

Also, for private **Game Worlds** user lists can be created by specifics clients to quickly restrict access to
the **Game World**. These user lists will be saved, and available for reuse in future **Game Worlds**.

Also, for **League** games, clients which are signed-up for a specific league will be automatically allowed to play
in **League** games.
