---

Inside the system there will exist a system of roles which will allow access to various functionality. For example,

- general game play
- user administration
- server management
- global announcements
- chatroom administration
- etc.

The roles can be freely added and removed for clients by a user with the power to do so.

Also, for private **Game Worlds** named user lists can be created by specifics clients to quickly restrict access to
the **Game World**.

Also, for **League** games, clients which are registered in the specific league will be automatically allowed to play
in **League** games.
