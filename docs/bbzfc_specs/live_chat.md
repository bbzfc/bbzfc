While logged into a game client, real-time chat system will be available. When not in a **Game World**, a client
will be able to chat in several different places:

1. General rooms. **Main Server** chat rooms created for specific topics. For example, **General Help**, **Random**,
**League talk**, etc.
2. Private chat rooms. Created by individual clients, these can be used by groups of people to discuss anything in
private. The creator of such a private room invites others to join. These private chatrooms are unlisted on the
**Main Server**.
3. Private chats. 1-to-1 chat system meant for discussions between 2 individuals.

When the client is in a **Game World** (in a game match, or as an observer), he has the following chats available to
him:

1. The in-game chat. Anyone currently in the **Game World** can use this chat. The messages are seen by everyone
playing or observing the match.
2. Private chats. You can chat with anyone (even users not currently in the current game match). This is meant for
1-to-1 discussion in private.

At any time, a user can decide to leave a specific chat room, or to not receive chat messages from specific individuals.
A user can also turn off the chat system altogether.

Also, there will exist special cases when an administrator will want to contact a user. In this case, even if the user
has turned off the chat functionality, administrators will be able to reach that user in a 1-to-1 chat session.
