Specific rules about tank and world dynamics. Not in any particular order.

- Rigid body physics.
- Simplified cartoon-like game world. **bbzfc** does not aim at reproducing the real world.
- Inside-the-cockpit FPS view for complete tank control (movement and shooting).
- Fly-by, and follow mode for simplified tank control (only movement)
- Gravity doesn't affect trajectory of bullets.
- One shot equals one kill.
- An in-game set of flags that modify the tank's abilities.
- Tank can go up ramps, and it tilts while doing this. Tank can shoot while tilted.
- Tank can drive forwards, backwards, turn left, turn right, jump, and shoot.
- Three possible projectiles for shooting: bullets, lasers, guided missiles.
