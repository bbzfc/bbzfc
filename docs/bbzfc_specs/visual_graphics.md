The visual graphics should:

- Be able to fully utilize video card's potential. The better the client's graphics card, the more graphical bells and
whistles available (different levels of lighting, different levels of shaders, different levels of detail, etc.).
- Should be implemented in a modern day fashion. I.e. using a programmable graphics pipeline.
- Give the impression of a modern-day game look and feel. Should not turn away new players because it looks like
a game from the 90s...
- Aesthetically pleasing to look at.
