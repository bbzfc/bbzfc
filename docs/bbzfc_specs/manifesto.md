# Manifesto

## General things

1. Create an extensible system which can be reused in future gaming projects. Ensure that the documentation and the API
is complete, and that the code base is written in a good style and well structured. It should be very easy for a
developer to pick up the project and start modifying it to his own needs.
2. Remain true to the original intent set out at project's start. The project is about creating a software solution that
can set up a **Tank Battle Portal**. The primary demonstrator of the project is a tank FPS game. If at some future
moment there will need to be made a decision about changing the core idea/concept of **bbzfc**, then a new project must
be created and **bbzfc** should continue to function as it was originally intended.
3. The original project documentation outlining the project ideas and goals can only be refined, and can't be
drastically changed. More detailed technical documentation with implementation specific details should be created and
maintained separately. Basically, the original documentation is a sort-of "technical manifesto".
4. If at some future moment it becomes apparent that the original project  plans simply can't be realized due to
technical limitations, that the project should stop any further development, and go into the dead phase of it's life
span.


## Project leadership

1. The project should strive to resolve all project related issues in a democratic way.
2. If there is a conflict, a debate, or a decision that must be made - the way to resolve it is through voting on the
matter. All of the current project developers can vote. The decision favored by the majority of those who voted is the
new that need to be followed through. If the voting process has a 50/50 outcome, then the project leader has the final
say.
3. The project leader must be transparent about the project status and the future milestones. The project should commit
to making news releases no later than 2 months after the previous news release. If this can't be met, then
the current project leader is not able to maintain his status any longer, and a new project leader should be chosen.
4. The old project leader must hand over all project control to the new project leader
5. The project is considered dead if a news release has not been made in the past 2 months, and there is no new leader
to take over the project leadership.
6. The project leader must resign if 100% of active developers sign a petition to replace him. An active developer is
a developer that responds to the petition within one (1) calendar month.
