The **bbzfc** project follows the [Open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) ideals.
From the start, the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) was chosen. Many things can be said about
the various licensing philosophizes, but the choice for **bbzfc** has already been made. So either enjoy this fact,
or go start your own project with another license = )
