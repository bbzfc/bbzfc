---

Users can get banned from a **Main Server** for the following reasons:

1. Abusive behavior.
2. Use of bad language while chatting.
3. Cheating.
4. Trying to break the system. Hacking.


## Who can ban a user?

First, the system, will be designed in such a way as to maximize the level of automation for discovering misbehaving
users. For example, a machine can be trained to notice bad language and/or cheating. However, some actions such as
abusive behavior (harassing, racial discrimination, etc.) can only be discovered by a human. So, there will be
some degree of policing involved. Also, there will be a mechanism for reporting a misbehaving user.


## Request for a ban on a specific user

If someone sees that someone else ids doing something bad, he can quickly report on that user. An in-game system will
be created to allow to request a ban with just 2-clicks. However, to prevent from misuse of this feature, if an
administrator reviewing this ban request (full logs of all player actions will be kept on a **Main Server**) will see
that there is no reason for it, then the player who requested the ban will get banned himself.


## How long does a ban last?

The 1-st ban lasts a month. The 2-nd ban lasts 2 months. The 3-rd ban lasts for 1 year. The 4-th ban will disable
the user record forever. While a user is banned, he can only communicate with the administrator of the **Main Server**
via e-mail.
