# Simplified server schema

[bbzfc specs](../bbzfc_specs.md) **>>** [Technical specifications](technical_specifications.md) **>>** [Servers](servers.md) **>>** `Simplified server schema`

If the whole **Battle Portal** idea is too grandiose for you, and you just want to play with a few friends on a LAN,
the **bbzfc** project will provide simplified installation scheme to minimize the burden on a PC. The simplified schema
will not include:

- support for web services
- support for user registration, and authentication
- support for a forum
- support for Leagues

Basically the whole server infrastructure will be setup on a single machine as economically as possible.

To access the server, you will just need to know it's LAN IP, and decide on a nickname for yourself. No password will be
required, you just can't choose the same nickname as someone else.
