Along with a **Main Server**, an optional forum can be rolled out. Registered clients can use it as a more permanent
place for discussions. Because the forum will be made available as an online service reachable by a web-browser, users
can more easily share content on it such as videos, images, and other digital medium.

As with many online games, a forum is a very necessary thing for a gamer community!
