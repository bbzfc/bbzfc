First, some pre-history.

2D and 3D tank games have been around for more than 30 years. One of the first notable titles was
[Battlezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_%281980_video_game%29), released in 1980. It was an arcade
single player game, utilizing vector graphics to simulate a 3D look and feel. It was a tremendous success
back then.

In the early 90s, another project took shape - [BZFlag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BZFlag). Although
BZFlag is being developed to this day, it's glory times were in the beginning of 2000s. Some of the cool things about
BZFlag were (are):

- minimalist 3D game allowing it to be played on a slow PC
- easy to grasp, hard to master; many hundreds of hours are needed to hone controls and tactical skills
- true multiplayer game; play on LAN or on the Internet
- an open source game (LGPL licence); although it should be noted that it wasn't open source in the beginning...

Fast forward to today, and you have available games such as the
[World of Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Tanks) (tanks are the main game elements), and
[Battlefield 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_4) (a FPS where tanks are one of many options of player
controllable vehicles). Both of these games are [MMOG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game),
with awesome 3D graphics utilizing the latest and greatest of today's video cards. Both of these games however are
closed source games.

I guess you might have guessed at this point that the aim of the **bbzfc** project is yet another tank game = )
Considering the rich ecosystem of tank games from the past and the present, bbzfc must have very precise goals
from the start to make sure that it falls into an empty (or as close to empty as possible) niche.

The following are the core goals of bbzfc:

- Open source game with code and assets available for free. Free for use, free for modification, free for
redistribution, free for modification and redistribution of the modifications.
- A massively multiplayer online game. More precisely, the server infrastructure of the game must be able to
scale well. So, the more resources you have, the more players can play simultaneously.
- A visually appealing 3D game. It should be able to utilize the latest and greatest of video cards with a noticeable
difference between game visuals from a low-end system and a high-end system. The game should have a modern day
look-and-feel to it.
- The game mechanics should be linear and easily mastered in a short period of time. The gameplay should be very
tactical, with an emphasis on precise and careful actions from the players. The technical skills required for becoming
a top player should require a large time commitment.
