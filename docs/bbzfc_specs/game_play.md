A client (player, gamer) plays the game controlling a tank inside a game world. The primary objective of the game is to
destroy other tanks and not get destroyed yourself.

The game can be played in the Single Player Mode, and Multiplayer Mode.


## Single Player Mode

In Single Player Mode an Internet connection is not required. The player can choose to play a training mission or a AI
mission. Training missions' objective is to destroy all static targets in as little of time as possible. AI missions
will present you with static targets and AI (Artificial Intelligence) controlled enemy tanks that will try to kill you.
AI missions' objective is to destroy all static targets in as little time ass possible **without getting killed**.
Single Player Mode missions will be available in various Game worlds (different maps, and other game rules to be
described later).


## Multiplayer Mode

In Multiplayer Mode a LAN connection or an Internet connection is required for joining a game. The player plays along
with others inside a Game World. Depending on the match type (to be described later), several objectives will be
presented to the player:

- destroy other tanks
- don't get killed
- capture territory
- capture the flag
