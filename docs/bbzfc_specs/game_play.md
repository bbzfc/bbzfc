**AI Missions** will present you with static targets and AI (Artificial Intelligence) controlled enemy tanks that will
try to destroy you. **AI Missions'** objective is to destroy all static targets in as little time ass possible
**without getting destroyed**. **Single Player Mode missions** will be available in various **Game Worlds** (different
maps, and other game rules to be described later).

with others inside a Game World. Depending on the match type (to be described later), several objectives will be
