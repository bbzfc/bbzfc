A client (player, gamer) plays the game controlling a tank inside a **Game World**. The primary objective of the game is
to destroy other tanks and not get destroyed yourself.

The game can be played in **Single Player Mode**, and **Multiplayer Mode**.


## Single Player Mode

In **Single Player Mode** an Internet connection (or a LAN connection) is not required. The player can choose to play a
**Training Mission** or an **AI Mission**. **Training Missions'** objective is to destroy all static targets in as
little of time as possible. **AI Missions** will present you with static targets and AI (Artificial Intelligence)
controlled enemy tanks that will try to destroy you. **AI Missions'** objective is to destroy all static targets in as
little time as possible "without getting destroyed". **Single Player Mode** missions will be available in various
pre-made **Game Worlds** (different maps, and other game rules to be described later), and also player-made custom
**Game Worlds**.


## Multiplayer Mode

In **Multiplayer Mode** a LAN connection or an Internet connection is required for joining a game. The player plays
along with others inside a **Game World**. Depending on the match type (to be described later), several objectives will
be presented to the player:

- destroy other tanks
- don't get destroyed
- capture territory
- capture the flag

**Multiplayer Mode** missions will be available in various pre-made **Game Worlds** (different maps, and other game
rules to be described later), and also player-made custom **Game Worlds**.
