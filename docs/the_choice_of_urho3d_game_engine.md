# The choice of Urho3D game engine

After carefully evaluating the 3 game engines listed in [List of possible 3D game engines](possible_3d_game_engines.md),
I decided to go with the Urho3D engine for the tank demonstrator that will go along with the **bbzfc** project. Some
of the reasons for this choice:

1. It is a pretty recent engine, actively being developed.
2. Uses the modern programmable graphics pipeline from the start.
3. Quite fast on a machine with low hardware parameters. For example on Raspberry Pi 2 Model B nearly all of the samples
that come along with Urho3D run at a fast speed.
