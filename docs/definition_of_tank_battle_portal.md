# What's a Tank Battle Portal?

Generally speaking, a **Tank Battle Portal** is a collection of resources enabling for a group of people
to play together online, battling each other by controlling tanks inside a virtual **Game World**. The project
**bbzfc** will provide free open-source software to create such portals. The following resources will be managed
by **bbzfc**:

- game client
- server infrastructure
- web forum service
- web Leagues service

What is required from the administrator of a portal is just providing resources for **bbzfc** powered
**Tank Battle Portal** to run on. The resources can be as simply as a single PC, or a complex infrastructure of cloud
hosted virtual machines. **bbzfc** will provide a collection of tools to help manage complex systems of servers so that
the portal administrator doesn't get boggled down in technical details.


## Costs of running a Tank Battle Portal

Of course, running a server solution to host a **Tank Battle Portal** costs money. Even if you just set up a single
home PC for this task, at least Internet connection charges must be paid. A portal administrator may choose to charge
the users (gamers) to use his portal. The best thing about the **bbzfc** project is that it's licensed under the MIT
license. So, you can use the **bbzfc** open source software to create and run the portal, but you don't have to pay
for it EVEN IF YOU CHARGE THE USERS USING YOUR PORTAL! = )


## Running a Tank Battle Portal for FREE

The project **bbzfc** will provide a simplified setup for cases when someone just wants to play on a LAN with his
friends. Obviously, everyone will have to be connected to the local area network to play. Such a scheme is free (without
taking into consideration the electrical bills).
