The **bbzfc** project will follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) methodology for versioning. This means
that by version 1.0.0, the project will have to be stable enough to be used in production. The plan is
to have a minimally functioning **bbzfc** by version 1, and also a publicly available **Battle Portal**
to show case what the project can do. This is pretty much what **Phase 1** is about. Also, by version
1.0.0 all of the public APIs (code wise, and service wise) will be stabilized.


## Phase 2

**Phase 2** will build upon version 1.0.0 of **bbzfc**, and continue adding new features. Any changes
introduced to the public API during **Phase 2** will be of a non-breaking nature. By the end of
**Phase 2**, all of the ideas outlined in [project specs](bbzfc_specs.md) will be realized. A more
detailed **Phase 2** road map will be created once **Phase 1** is complete.


## Phase 3

Building upon the experience, a version 2 will be created, and **bbzfc** project will be rewritten mostly
from scratch. The plan is to make a better version of **bbzfc** project based on the lessons learned while
working on version 1.x.x, and also operating a public **Battle Portal**. Another goal for version 2.0.0
is to introduce a different game demonstrator along with a whole documentation/tutorial on how to build
a 3D FPS game and integrate it with the **bbzfc** system. Version 2.0.0 will introduce breaking API changes
with version 1.x.x.


## Phase 4

To be defined.
